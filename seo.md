## SEO With Decoupled Sites

Because the front end is completely custom, implementing the features [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) normally automatically provides has to be done manually by developers. For content editors, this does not change much. Meta descriptions, meta titles, and other SEO information on a page is edited in the exact same way.

However, there is some warranted concern that decoupled sites may not be implementing certain SEO features correctly. This section explains how the generator implements the features that Yoast provides.

If you are only interested in editing content, there are no important differences in editing SEO settings on pages, and this documentation can be skipped. You can continue to edit SEO information the same way you do on normal WordPress sites. The below sections are for those who dive deep into SEO and want to know how static sites implement Yoast's features.

## Yoast Integration

The generator gets information from the Yoast plugin. It does so by using a plugin called [WPGraphQL Yoast SEO Addon](https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-wpgraphql-seo/). This plugin exposes important SEO information entered in the WordPress editor for pages, and allows us to implement Yoast's features manually on the front end.

So, saying that decoupled sites do not use Yoast is technically incorrect. Decoupled sites use Yoast for a convenient and familiar user interface, while implementing its features manually and slightly differently. Yoast performs important SEO functions, such as generating schema for each page automatically, which the generator still takes advantage of.

## Schema

### JSON Schema

Yoast will automatically generate JSON schema for each page based on the site's Yoast configuration. This schema contains important SEO information, like the page type and information on the business. The generator will always query this schema for each page or post and place it in the `head` element in an appropriate `script` tag:

![YOAST Schema](/_media/schema.png)

This is identical to the normal functionality of Yoast, and is what allows pages to have [rich search results](https://support.google.com/programmable-search/answer/1626952?hl=en):

### FAQ Schema

Yoast FAQ blocks use [Schema Markup](https://moz.com/learn/seo/schema-structured-data), which means the schema information is embedded in the HTML of the site. The generator pulls the HTML for page content as it is generated by WordPress, and places it in its appropriate location. For this reason, FAQ blocks will continue to work as intended without any modification.

## Meta Tags

### Information Tags

Yoast exposes _a lot_ of meta information that we include on pages. For more information on Open Graph, the protocol abided by social media like Twitter and Facebook, visit their official [documentation](https://ogp.me/) These include:

- Meta title `title`
- Meta description `description`
- Open Graph title `og:title`
- Open Graph description `og:description`
- Open Graph type `og:type`
- Summary for Twitter embeds `twitter:card`
- Title for Twitter embeds (just the meta title) `twitter:title`
- Description for Twitter embeds (just the meta description) `twitter:description`
