## JSON Schema

Yoast will automatically generate JSON schema for each page based on the site's Yoast configuration. This schema contains important SEO information, like the page type and information on the business. The generator will always query this schema for each page or post and place it in the `head` element in an appropriate `script` tag:

![YOAST Schema](/_media/schema.png)

This is identical to the normal functionality of Yoast, and is what allows pages to have [rich search results](https://support.google.com/programmable-search/answer/1626952?hl=en):

## FAQ Schema

Yoast FAQ blocks use [Schema Markup](https://moz.com/learn/seo/schema-structured-data), which means the schema information is embedded in the HTML of the site. The generator pulls the HTML for page content as it is generated by WordPress, and places it in its appropriate location. For this reason, FAQ blocks will continue to work as intended without any modification.
