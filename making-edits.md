## Prior Knowledge

Editing content on a headless WordPress instance is practically the same process, but has some novel differences that can frustrate you if you aren't wary of them. The below sections explain in detail the aspects of content editing that have changed with a headless setup. Since this only covers the _differences_ from normal WordPress editing, a firm understanding of the backend and editing is required to make any sense of what is below. For more information, see [WordPress's official docs](https://wordpress.com/learn/get-published/).

## Getting To The WordPress Editor

Because WordPress is decoupled from the website, you **will not** have an admin bar that will take you to the backend, or let you edit a page directly when viewing the page using the `Edit Page` button:

Instead, you will have to navigate to the page's backend manually, as you would normally. All static sites have a redirect for `/wp-admin` that will take you to the WordPress backend for that site.

For example, Esquire Digital (https://www.esquiredigital.com) is a static site. Even if you are logged in, there will be no admin bar at the top of the page to take you to the back end. Instead, navigating to https://www.esquiredigital.com/wp-admin will take you to the backend, where you can perform the necessary edits.

**How it works**

The website has a 301 redirect rule that redirects the page `/wp-admin` to the WordPress dashboard which is hosted separately. Notice that https://www.esquiredigital.com/wp-admin will redirect you to the domain edit.esquiredigital.com. They are still in two different locations, but for ease of access, we include a redirect.

In case you are worried about SEO, crawlers will not crawl the path `/wp-admin` because it is disallowed in the site's `robots.txt` file:

```robots.txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /wp-admin
Sitemap: https://www.marronelaw.com/sitemap.xml
Host: https://www.marronelaw.com
```

## Navigating

Because the site is decoupled, we do not want web crawlers to accidentally index pages generated by WordPress. To solve this, we **redirect users not logged in to the appropriate page on the front end**. For example, if you navigate to the WordPress install for Esquire Digital while not logged in (https://edit.esquiredigital.com), it will redirect you to the actual website (https://www.esquiredigital.com).

Because of this, navigating to make page edits can become more difficult because you cannot use the menu on the website to get to the page wanted and hit the `Edit Page` button. In fact, you will be greeted by a white screen or a splash page if you go to any page while logged in to the WordPress dashboard. Instead, you have to find the page you want in the pages section of the WordPress dashboard, and edit it from there.

We are working on making a simple theme that helps editors navigate pages when they are logged in. This documentation will be updated to include that when it is ready.

## Custom Fields

Custom fields operate the same way, except for one difference. The framework we use limits us from targeting specific _types_ of pages to display fields on. On many sites, changing the template of a page will make fields appear specific to that page template.

Unfortunately, this is not currently possible with the way we decouple sites. Any field that appears on pages, whether it should be used only on one type of page or every type, it will appear on _every_ page. This inevitably clutters the page editor with fields that are irrelevant to most pages.

**Why? (Danger: Technical details, read at your own peril)**

In order to decouple WordPress from the actual website, we must expose the data over an API. The API we use, [GraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/), does not expose a way to retrieve data specific to a _type_ of page. If we make a custom field only appear on a certain page template, it effectively becomes unreachable and useless.

## Favicon

The favicon is **not** queried by the website when building, so it cannot be changed from inside WordPress. Changing the favicon using the `Site Icon` setting in the customizer will only set the favicon for the WordPress dashboard. To change a favicon, contact a developer.
